This README is basically a brief of what Abe did to organize the the (CSS) styling and (HTML) structure of DrSusanBlock.tv

### How do I get set up? ###

* Sublime Text Editor 2 - personal favorite and needed it you want to use SCSS (SASS)
* Terminal to open .sh files (these initiate SASS which creates CSS files out of your SCSS files)

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Repo maintained by Bonobo Designs.
